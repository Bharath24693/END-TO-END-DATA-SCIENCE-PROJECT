# END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID: CT04DF229

DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

## TASK DESCRIPTION

This internship requires the completion of an end-to-end data science project, beginning with data collection and ending with model deployment through a web framework such as Flask or FastAPI. The objective is to provide practical exposure to the complete data science workflow while solving a real-world problem.

Participants should start by identifying a problem statement that can be addressed using data. Next, data must be collected from reliable sources such as open datasets, APIs, databases, or web scraping techniques. After acquiring the data, it must undergo cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and managing outliers. Once cleaned, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to understand trends, patterns, and relationships in the dataset. 

Visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly can be used to support this analysis. Based on insights from EDA, interns should proceed with feature engineering, which may involve creating new variables, encoding categorical data, and selecting important features that influence the target variable. Preprocessing steps such as scaling, normalization, and data transformation should be performed as needed to prepare the dataset for modeling. Following this, multiple machine learning models should be developed using tools like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, or TensorFlow, depending on the task.

Interns must evaluate models using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC for classification, or RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for regression problems. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV should be used to enhance model performance. Once the optimal model is selected, it should be serialized using joblib or pickle for use in deployment.

Interns must then build a web application or API interface using Flask or FastAPI, where users can input data and receive model predictions in real time. The API or web app should be deployed to a public cloud platform like Heroku, Render, or AWS so it can be accessed online. Clear documentation must accompany the project, including a README file detailing setup instructions, data sources, model logic, and how to interact with the API or web app. A GitHub repository should be maintained throughout the internship, containing the codebase, version history, datasets (if allowed), and deployment files. 

The final deliverable is a publicly deployed model wrapped in an interactive interface, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world problems. Interns are encouraged to focus on both technical implementation and communication of insights. The internship is designed to enhance skills in data wrangling, machine learning, software engineering, and cloud deployment. 

By the end of the internship period, each participant should have a comprehensive, self-developed project showcasing their understanding of the entire data science process. This project can be used as a portfolio piece when applying for jobs or further academic programs. A certificate of completion will be issued by CodTech upon successful submission of the deployed project and accompanying materials by the internship end date.
